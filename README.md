# DroneCodingTest
Upon reading the test statement, I noticed that the test's output does not match the statement. I understood the logic behind the output, but it doesn't comply with what the statement requests. So, I was unsure: should I describe the logic behind the output, or should I adhere to the test's statement and generate the correct output as requested? I decided to follow the statement, even though the output may differ. If I have the opportunity to explain why the result generated by my algorithm is correct and why the provided output does not align with the statement, that would be excellent.
